# Delta Defense Test

To start, clone the repo, make sure you have Node.js installed and then run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

After it finishes, you should see an address where you can view the application in your browser. Any changes made to the files will automatically be recompiled and the browser will automatically be updated with the new code.

If you'd like to build a production version of the application, run

```
npm run build
```
